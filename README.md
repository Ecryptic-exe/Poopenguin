# 🐧 Poopenguin Discord Bot

**Poopenguin** is a quirky and clever bot built to spice up your Discord server with automated responses and timeout voting features. Perfect for chaotic group chats and spontaneous fun.

## 💬 Features

- **Timeout Voting System**  
  If a timeout-worthy moment arises, users can cast votes. The bot handles the tallying and enforces the timeout if consensus is reached.

- **Mimicry Trigger**  
  When three different users send the **exact same message** consecutively, Poopenguin joins the bandwagon and echoes the phrase too.

- **Copypasta Trigger**
  When the bot detects the term 兒歌, it responds by sending a predefined copypasta to stir up the chaos even more. The exact message can be customized to fit your server's unique flavor of nonsense.


## 🤖 Why Naming it Poopenguin?

Because Chunithm players deserve a little chaos, camaraderie, and a penguin with attitude.

## 📦 Required Packages

- Discord
- Python 3.9
